ls()  Prints all the variable names in the memory

'<-'  is same as '='

c(1,2,6,7)  creates a vector(data structure) of size 4 ;c stands for combine
**Try not to combine 2 differnt data types in one vector

vector1[3] Output the 3rd element of vector1

seq(a,b,c)    creates a sequence of numbers start from a end at b with
              each increment of c.

Data Frames (A data structure)
DataFrame = data.frame(vector1,vector2) combines 2 vectors to form a single
Frame

DataFrame $ newVector = c(23,9,24,42)

NewDataFrame  = rbind(DataFrame1,DataFrame2)  combines data Frames by stacking
the rows.

getwd()   :prints working directory

names(DataFrame)	return the names of all the varibles in the DataFrames


WHO_Dataframe(that will be created)=read.csv("WHO_filename.csv")

Types of variable
  1.Factor
  2.num : numerical
  3.int : integers
  4.Logical : TRUE / FALSE
No of differnt levels means no of possible valuues

str(DataFrame)
summary(DataFrame)     NA ("indicate that values are missing ")
DataFrame $ Variable_name  (outputs the vector corresponding to that varible)

mean(DataFrame $ Variable_name )	(gives mean)
sd(DataFrame $ Variable_name )		(gives standard deviation)
summary(DataFrame $ Variable_name )	(mean median	1st Quartile: value for which 25% of data is less than this
							3rd Quartile: value for which 75% of data is less than this)
which.min(DataFrame $ Variable_name),which.max()   	(returns the row no. of the one with min and max values)

plot(DataFrame $ Var1,DataFrame $ Var2)		(scatter plot)

nrow(DataFrame)		(no of rows/obsrvations)

his(WHO $ Var)		(plots a histogram a histogram is useful for anlysing the distrubtn of a var)



boxplot(WHO $ Var - WHO $ Var2)		(creates a boxplot to show range of var1 ---  :whiskers show range  box(from 1st to 3rd quartile 
						O :Outliers compputed as those that are higher than )
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRlTh5HQORA


boxplot(WHO $ Var - WHO $ Var2,xlab="X-Axis",y-lab="Y-Axis",main="Title")

tables(WHO $ Var)		(Summary )


tapply(WHO$Over60,WHO$Region,mean)		Splits the data/occurance according to region(1) and take the mean(3) of the data of variable 							Over60(1)



# to comment

match("TEXT",vector_name)	will search for the text in the vector







as.numeric(vector) changes logical values to numeric


modelname=lm( dep_var ~ indep_var,data=data_frame)	lm:linear model


Residuals: Erroe terms
intercept: Beta_0
varname: Beta_1 


Multiple R-squared: As discussed in the video
Adjusted R-squared: R^2 adjusted for the "no of variables used relative to the number of data points".

"Multiple R^2 always increase when more variables are added but Adjusted R^2 may decrease when more variables are added."



predict(modelname,newdata=teat_dataframe)




SSE=sum(modelname $ residuals^2)   

if any varible begins with a no. R will put an 'X' in front of it. 
How do you access the adjusted r squared and the multiple r squared in the linear regression output because I obtain NULL?

Did a little experimenting. We could also use:

> summary(model2)$r.squared
[1] 0.7073708   

summary(model2)$adj.r.squared
[1] 0.6807681
